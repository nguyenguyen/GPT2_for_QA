As soon as the tailor had gone Miss Medea asked me if i would not like to take another run in the garden. i knew that she wished to speak to her father and therefore had a pleasure in disappointing her. i therefore replied that i had been there nearly the whole day and did not wish to go out any more.

Know then that when you were last at Madeline Hall i was sent for to draw up the will of the Honourable Miss Delmar and i then discovered that the will which had been made in favour of Lord de Versely to whom Miss Delmar had left everything was by his express desire to be altered in your favour and at the same time the secret of your birth was confided to me. You will see therefore that Lord de Versely did not neglect your interests. The Honourable Miss Delmar having had such a long innings then gave it up because she was out of breath. She reads a great deal and is therefore only a customer to the library. Ladies who are fond of reading are seldom fond of working. Good morning Miss Evans said Captain Bridgeman you come for more food for the mind i presume. Miss Evans gave a bob and turned to my mother. Have you anything new Mrs Keene. i have brought back the three volumes of Godolphin. Yes miss i have some books down to day. Mercy on me how very like. exclaimed Miss Culpepper looking at me and then at her father.

Well well i know that she was proud her mother was always a proud woman. Mr Mason in his younger days held property of his own at least his father did but he ran through it revelling and horse racing but what does that prove. Write to me my dear boy and tell me how this unfortunate mistake happened and believe me to be your affectionate mother arabella keene. i read this letter over ten times before i came to any conclusion at last i said to myself there is not in any one part of it any positive denial of the fact and resolved some future day when i had had some conversation with Bob Cross to show it to him and ask his opinion. chapter sixteen. i have been nearly fifty years in the family as a confidential Captain Bridgeman the old lord was very fond of my husband who was his steward but he died poor man a long while ago i am sure it would have broken his heart if in his lifetime my daughter Arabella had made the foolish marriage which she did with a private marine however what's done ca not be helped as the saying is that's all over now. The candle required snuffing i raised the letter to the light that i might read it and read as follows. my dear arabella. You must prepare yourself for very melancholy tidings and it is most painful to me to be compelled to be the party who communicates them. a dreadful accident has occurred and indeed i feel most sincerely for you. But if her mistress was appeased Mrs Keene's mother was not. As soon as the intelligence was received old Mrs Mason set off for Madeline Hall. i know that i can say nothing that will alleviate your sufferings and yet i fain would for you have been so true and anxious to please me in every point since our first acquaintance and intimacy that there is nothing that you do not deserve at my hands. Comfort yourself dear Arabella as well as you can with the reflection that it has been the will of Heaven to whose decrees we must submit with resignation. o very well replied i but I'm a freemason and so is he and he's never severe with a brother mason. But how did he know you were a mason. i made the sign to him the very first time that he began to scold me and he left off almost immediately that is when i made the second sign he did not when i made the first. i should like to know these signs. Wo not you tell them to me. Tell them to you. Mrs Mason was often invited by the Honourable Miss Delmar to spend a month at Madeline Hall and used to bring her eldest daughter who had left school with her. Latterly however the daughter remained as a fixture and Mrs Mason received but an occasional invitation. Shortly afterwards Captain Delmar again came over to Madeline Hall accompanied as usual by Ben and the second day after their arrival it was made known to all whom it might concern that Miss Arabella Mason had actually contracted a secret marriage with the handsome Benjamin Keene. Of course the last person made acquainted with this interesting intelligence was the Honourable Miss Delmar and her nephew took upon himself to make the communication. Miss Arabella Mason was the eldest daughter of the steward of the old Lord de Versely brother to the Honourable Miss Delmar and was much respected by his lordship for his fidelity and his knowledge of business in the transaction of which he fell for he was felling trees and a tree fell upon him. He left a widow and two daughters it was said that at his death Mrs Mason was not badly off as her husband had been very careful of his earnings.", "qas": [{"answers": "Ben Keene, Delmar's valet", "question": "Who does Arabella Mason wed", "id": "0029bdbe75423337b551e42bb31f9a102785376f1"}, {"answers": "Ben Keene", "question": "Who does Arabella Mason wed", "id": "0029bdbe75423337b551e42bb31f9a102785376f1"}]}, {"context": "Granny has told him to treat me ill said i that's very clear from what he said never mind i will make her sorry for it.

In the following years he wrote books many of which are among the very best of English literature and some of which are still in print. Marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories. He certainly was a literary genius. Percival Keene was published in the nineteenth book to flow from Marryat's pen.

As for my own thoughts they may be given in a few words they were upon the vanity of human wishes. Whatever i had done with the one object i had in view whatever might have been my success had i lived whether i might have been wedded to Minnie some future day or what may have resulted good bad or indifferent as to future all was to be in a few hours cut short by the will of Heaven. i did so again and again until the night wore away and tired out at last i fell fast asleep.

The next day after i had been on board of the schooner and given my orders to Bob Cross i returned to Mr Fraser and sat down to write to Mr Vanderwelt i also wrote to Minnie which i had never done before. Shortly afterwards we went to bed. i must say his description of Minnie which was even much more in detail than i have narrated to the reader did prevent my going to sleep for a long while. Women as the reader may have seen never once troubled my thoughts. i thought that the week would never expire but like all other weeks it died a natural death at last and we were united. The fete was over the company had all left us and we were again alone and i held my dearest Minnie in my arms when Mr Vanderwelt brought me in a letter from England. It was from Mr Warden and i hastily opened it. Minnie shared my impatience and read over my shoulder. The contents were as follows. my dear captain keene. i could not sleep last night Minnie and it was all your fault. My fault. Yes your fault for i could not sleep for thinking of you i thought you were looking at me as you do now the whole night. Minnie blushed and i kissed her hand. As soon as my wound was dressed i requested writing materials and wrote to the Admiralty giving an account of what had occurred since i quitted Heligoland. i had written to inform them of the loss of the frigate when i was on the island. If you knew how delighted i am to see you and be able to express my thanks said Mynheer Vanderwelt and poor Minnie too. How often have we talked over that dreadful day and wondered if ever we should see you again. i assure you on my honour that now i no longer regret the capture of the island. Minnie stood by me during the time her father was speaking her large blue eyes beaming through the tears with which they brimmed and as i turned to her our eyes met and she smiled. He had often heard the history of my saving their lives on board of the pirate vessel from Mr Vanderwelt who made it a constant theme of his discourse and added Mr Fraser You do not know what a regard he has for you. And little Minnie sir. inquired i it is now nearly five years since i saw her. Little Minnie is no longer little Minnie Mr Keene i can assure you. She was fifteen when she left the island and had grown a tall and very beautiful girl. And you wo not go to sea any more will you Percival. said Minnie.
